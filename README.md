wordwind
========

A turn-based iOS social word game.  Players take turns in a format
similar to scramble with friends.  For each turn
the current player gets 5 letters (this number could change).  He or she
rearranges those letters to form as many words 
as possible within the 2 minutes.  To move on to the next round, the
player must guess a word that uses all 5 letters. 
If the player does not guess the word, the other player will have the
next turn to score as many points as possible and
will easily win.  Games could be capped at 3 rounds w/ the 3rd round
being some sort of time extension based round for
guessing the word multiple times (i.e. if you guess the 5 letter word
you get new letters and more time).

wordwind is build on the Kobold2D starter implementation based on
Cocos2D.  Download Kobold2D here:

Hopefully it isn't that hard to setup.
